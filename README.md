# FinalProject
The goal of our project was to create a complex gaming simulation program. What we have created is a Basketball Simulator that prompts two users to pick a team of 5 players each. Once a player is picked they cannot be picked again. In our program we used used a csv of that contained individual basketball stats from the 2018-2019 NBA basketball season. We used player’s points, assists, defensive rebounds, steals, and blocks from the season to determine an overall point value or rating for each player. The equation we created is as follows: (points*assists)/ (defensive rebounds + steals + blocks). The rating of the each player is combined to team rank value. Which ever user’s team has a higher rank value they win the game. Simple.
